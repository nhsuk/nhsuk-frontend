/// Suppressed warnings map
///
/// This map is used to determine which deprecation warnings to **not** show
/// to users when compiling sass. This is in place for codebases that do not
/// have the necessary capacity to upgrade and remove the deprecation,
/// particularly if the deprecation is significant. For example, the removal of
/// mixins and functions that were previously available to users of frontend.
///
/// You can add to this map and define which warnings to suppress by appending to
/// it using the warning key, found in the warning message. For example:
///
/// @example scss
///   // warning message:
///   //  $foobar is no longer supported. To silence this warning, update
///   //  $nhsuk-suppressed-warnings with key: "foobar"
///   $nhsuk-suppressed-warnings: (
///     foobar
///   );

/// Warnings
///
/// Acts as a wrapper for the built in `@warn` sass function
///
/// We use this instead of using `@warn` for 3 reasons:
///
/// - To check if a warning is being suppressed through `$nhsuk-suppressed-warnings`,
/// in which case we don't call `@warn` and printing the warning to the user
/// - To format the passed warning `$message` with the warning key at the end
/// - To prevent duplicate warnings by adding the passed `$key` to
/// `$nhsuk-suppressed-warnings` after `@warn` is called to ensure it only runs
/// once per sass compilation
///
/// @param {String} $key - The key to be checked against `$nhsuk-suppressed-warnings`
/// and then passed to it to prevent multiple of the same warning.
/// @param {String} $message - The message to use when calling `@warn`
/// @param {Boolean} $silence-further-warnings - Whether to silence future
/// warnings that use the same $key
///
