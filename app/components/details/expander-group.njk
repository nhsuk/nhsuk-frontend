          <p>Testing your blood at home is quick and easy, although it can be uncomfortable. It does get better.</p>
          <p>You would have been given:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a blood glucose metre</li>
            <li>small needles called lancets</li>
            <li>a plastic pen to hold the lancest</li>
            <li>small test strips</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Try to check your blood:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>before meals</li>
            <li>2 to 3 hours after meals</li>
            <li>before, during (take a break) and after exercise</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This helps you understand your blood glucose levels and how they're affected by meals and exercise. It should help you have more stable blood glucose levels.</p>
