/// Word break

/// @group utilities

/// This class allows words to be broken between any 2
/// to avoid overflowing their container.
///
/// This can be useful on table cells which could contain
/// long strings such as email addresses.
///
/// @example html
///   <td class="nhsuk-u-word-break-all"></td>

.nhsuk-u-word-break-all {
  word-break: break-all;
}

/// This class also allows words to be broken between any 2
/// to avoid overflowing their container, but will try
/// and avoid it by placing the entire word on its own
/// line first. However this does not work in tables.
///
/// @example html
///   <p class="nhsuk-u-word-break-word"></p>

.nhsuk-u-word-break-word {
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
}
