/// mq() takes up to three optional parameters:
/// $from: inclusive min-width boundary
/// $until: exclusive max-width boundary
/// $and: additional custom directives
/// $media-type: $mq-media-type // defaults to 'all'
///
/// 1. To enable support for browsers that do not support @media queries,
///    (IE <= 8, Firefox <= 3, Opera <= 9) set $mq-responsive to false
///    Create a separate stylesheet served exclusively to these browsers,
///    meaning @media queries will be rasterized, relying on the cascade itself
/// 2. Define the breakpoint from the $mq-breakpoints list that should
///    be used as the target width when outputting a static stylesheet
///    (i.e. when $mq-responsive is set to 'false').
