/// Panel component
///
/// 1. Adds a transparent border for high contrast modes
/// 2. This subtracts the transparent border width from the padding (because the border
///    visually adds to the total padding)
/// 3. This is an if-all-else-fails attempt to stop long words from overflowing the container
///    on very narrow viewports by forcing them to break and wrap instead. This
///    overflowing is more likely to happen when user increases text size on a mobile eg. using
///    iOS Safari text resize controls.

///    The overflowing is a particular problem with the panel component since it uses white
///    text: when the text overflows the container, it is invisible on the white (page)
///    background. When the text in our other components overflow, the user might have to scroll
///    horizontally to view it but the text remains legible.
/// 4. Support IE (autoprefixer doesn't add this as it's not a prefix)
///
