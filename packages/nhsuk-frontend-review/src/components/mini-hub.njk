      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common condition that affects the middle part of your vision.</strong> It usually first affects people in their 50s and 60s.</li>
        <li><strong>It doesn't cause total blindness.</strong> But it can make everyday activities like reading and recognising faces difficult.</li>
        <li><strong>Without treatment, your vision may get worse.</strong> This can happen gradually over several years ("dry AMD"), or quickly over a few weeks or months ("wet AMD").</li>
        <li><strong>The exact cause is unknown.</strong> It's been linked to smoking, high blood pressure, being overweight and having a family history of AMD.</li>
      </ul>
