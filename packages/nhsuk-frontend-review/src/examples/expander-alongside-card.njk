          <li>a blood glucose metre</li>
          <li>small needles called lancets</li>

        <p>Try to check your blood:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>before meals</li>
          <li>2 to 3 hours after meals</li>
          <li>before, during (take a break) and after exercise</li>

        <p>This helps you understand your blood glucose levels and how they're affected by meals and exercise. It should help you have more stable blood glucose levels.</p>
