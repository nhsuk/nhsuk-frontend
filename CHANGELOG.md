## 4.0.0 - 26 October 2020

:boom: **Breaking changes**

- Tables - New responsive table component, when viewed on a desktop the table component will behave like any other table. However, when viewed on a mobile the table collapses into what appears to be a group list style component. ([Pull request 635](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/635))

  If you are using the current responsive table class `nhsuk-table-responsive` you will need to rename the `nhsuk-table-responsive` class to `nhsuk-table-container`.

  [Preview the responsive table component](https://nhsuk.github.io/nhsuk-frontend/components/tables/responsive-table.html)

- Remove Panel and Promo components

  The panel and promo were two components in the NHS.UK frontend that did not have guidance in the service manual. They both also shared a lot of the same structure and design. This confused users of the design system, with people not knowing when and how to use the components.

  There was also an accessibility issue with the content of the promo component being all contained within a link (anchor tag) causing a difficult experience for screenreader users. We have fixed this issue and combined the two components into one new component, a card component.

  <details>
    <summary>If you are using a panel component</summary>

    You will need to replace the panel component with a card component.

    ### For Nunjucks macro

    You need to:
    - replace `{% from 'components/panel/macro.njk' import panel %}` with `{% from 'components/card/macro.njk' import card %}`
    - replace `{{ panel({` with `{{ card({`
    - replace `"html"` with the relevant arguments - for example: `"heading"` and `"descriptionHtml"`
    - declare the heading level size and heading sizes (with helper classes) because the default heading level is now 2 instead of 3

    For example:

    #### Old Nunjucks macro (Panel)

    ```
    {% from 'components/panel/macro.njk' import panel %}

    {{ panel({
      "html": "<h3>If you need help now, but it’s not an emergency</h3> <p>Go to <a href=\"#\">111.nhs.uk</a> or <a href=\"#\">call 111</a>.</p>"
    }) }}
    ```

    #### New Nunjucks macro (Card)

    ##### Changing the heading level

    ```
    {% from 'components/card/macro.njk' import card %}

    {{ card({
      "heading": "If you need help now, but it’s not an emergency",
      "headingLevel": "3",
      "descriptionHtml": "<p class=\"nhsuk-card__description\">Go to <a href=\"#\">111.nhs.uk</a> or <a href=\"#\">call 111</a>.</p>"
    }) }}
    ```

    ##### Changing the heading size

    ```
    {% from 'components/card/macro.njk' import card %}

    {{ card({
      "heading": "If you need help now, but it’s not an emergency",
      "headingClasses": "nhsuk-heading-m",
      "descriptionHtml": "<p class=\"nhsuk-card__description\">Go to <a href=\"#\">111.nhs.uk</a> or <a href=\"#\">call 111</a>.</p>"
    }) }}
    ```

    ### For HTML

    You need to:
    - replace all `nhsuk-panel` classes to `nhsuk-card`

    For example:

    #### Old HTML (Panel)

    ```
    <div class="nhsuk-panel nhsuk-panel--grey">
      <h3>If you need help now, but it’s not an emergency</h3>
      <p>Go to <a href="#">111.nhs.uk</a> or <a href="tel: 111">call 111</a>.</p>
    </div>
    ```

    #### New HTML (Card)

    ```
    <div class="nhsuk-card>
      <div class="nhsuk-card__content">
        <h3 class="nhsuk-card__heading">If you need help now, but it’s not an emergency</h3>
        <p>Go to <a href="#">111.nhs.uk</a> or <a href="#">call 111</a>.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    ```
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>If you are using a promo component</summary>

    You will need to replace the promo component with a card component.

    ### For Nunjucks macro

    You need to:
    - replace `{% from 'components/promo/macro.njk' import promo %}` with `{% from 'components/card/macro.njk' import card %}`
    - replace `{{ promo({` with `{{ card({`
    - declare the heading level size and heading sizes (with helper classes) because the default heading level is now 2 instead of 3

    For example:

    #### Old Nunjucks macro (Promo)

    ```
    {% from 'components/promo/macro.njk' import promo %}

    {{ promo({
      "href": "https://www.nhs.uk",
      "heading": "Save a life: give blood",
      "description": "Please register today. Donating blood is easy, and saves lives."
    }) }}
    ```

    #### New Nunjucks macro (Card)

    ##### Changing the heading level

    ```
    {% from 'components/card/macro.njk' import card %}

    {{ card({
      "href": "https://www.nhs.uk",
      "heading": "Save a life: give blood",
      "headingLevel": "3",
      "description": "Please register today. Donating blood is easy, and saves lives."
    }) }
    ```

    ##### Changing the heading size

    ```
    {% from 'components/card/macro.njk' import card %}

    {{ card({
      "href": "https://www.nhs.uk",
      "heading": "Save a life: give blood",
      "headingClasses": "nhsuk-heading-m",
      "description": "Please register today. Donating blood is easy, and saves lives."
    }) }
    ```

    ### For HTML

    You need to:
    - replace all `nhsuk-promo` classes to `nhsuk-card`
    - remove surrounding `<a class="nhsuk-promo__link-wrapper" href="#">` and add `<a class="nhsuk-card__link" href="#">` within `<h3 class="nhsuk-card__heading">`
    - add `nhsuk-card--clickable` class to make entire card clickable

    For example:

    #### Old HTML (Promo)

    ```
    <div class="nhsuk-promo">
      <a class="nhsuk-promo__link-wrapper" href="#">
        <img class="nhsuk-promo__img" src="https://assets.nhs.uk/prod/images/020720_PHE_Barrington_5426_TRL3_CL.2e16d0ba.fill-720x405.jpg" alt="">
        <div class="nhsuk-promo__content">
          <h3 class="nhsuk-promo__heading">Kickstart your health</h3>
          <p class="nhsuk-promo__description">It's never too late to get your health back on track. Eat well, move more and start losing weight with Better Health. Try our NHS weight loss plan to get you started.</p>
        </div>
      </a>
    </div>
    ```

    #### New HTML (Card)

    ```
    <div class="nhsuk-card nhsuk-card--clickable">
      <img class="nhsuk-card__img" src="https://assets.nhs.uk/prod/images/020720_PHE_Barrington_5426_TRL3_CL.2e16d0ba.fill-720x405.jpg" alt="">
      <div class="nhsuk-card__content">
        <h3 class="nhsuk-card__heading">
          <a class="nhsuk-card__link" href="#">Kickstart your health</a>
        </h3>
        <p class="nhsuk-card__description">It's never too late to get your health back on track. Eat well, move more and start losing weight with Better Health. Try our NHS weight loss plan to get you started.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    ```
  </details>

  ([PR 627](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/627))

:new: **New features**

- Add Card component

  Use a card instead of a panel or promo to provide users with a brief summary of content or a task, often with a link to more detail. Cards are frequently displayed alongside other cards to group related content or tasks.

  ([PR 627](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/627))

- Add Tag component

  Use the tag component when it’s possible for something to have more than one status and it’s useful for the user to know about that status.

  ([PR 626](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/626))

- Add `nhsuk-link--no-visited-state` mixin - for where it is not helpful to distinguish between visited and non-visited links.

- Custom search API endpoint – Improving the search experience it's now possible to define a custom API endpoint in the HTML. The JavaScript will check the window object to look for a new API reference, if nothing is found it will default to the standard NHS reference. 

  Add the below code to a base HTML file or any pages that use search.

```HTML
    <script>
      window.NHSUK_SETTINGS = {};
      window.NHSUK_SETTINGS.SUGGESTIONS_TEST_HOST = "[CUSTOM API ENDPOINT]";
      window.NHSUK_SETTINGS.SEARCH_TEST_HOST = "[CUSTOM SEARCH PAGE URL]";
    </script>
```

:wrench: **Fixes**

- Hints - changed hints to be div instead of span to allow multi-line elements ([Issue 620](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/620))
- Details - fix the left alignment of the details text and summary ([Issue 615](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/615))
- Focus styling - Fixing issues with focus state on input and text area which caused resizing ([Issue 600](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/600) and [Issue 613](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/613))
- Fix styles for the `nhsuk-link-style-white`
- Fix breadcrumb link color when `:visited` and `:focus`
- Warning callout - update Nunjucks macro template so custom headings get prefixed with `<span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Important:</span>` to convey the importance of the message to screen reader users. ([PR 630](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/630))
- Style updates to a few components so that they render properly on a range of quality monitors and devices found in use in the NHS.

  Including adding a 1px border to:
  - care cards (non-urgent and urgent)
  - do and don't list
  - expander
  - warning callout

## 3.1.0 - 24 April 2020

:new: **New features**

- Checkboxes with conditional content - add functionality to show and hide conditional content when checkbox is checked
- Radios with conditional content - add functionality to show and hide conditional content when radio is checked
- JS utils - add addClass, removeClass, getClasses and hasClass utils

  **Conditional and polyfill JavaScript**

  Add the following JavaScript to the top of the `<body>` section of your page template:

  ```
  document.body.className = ((document.body.className) ? document.body.className + ' js-enabled' : 'js-enabled');
  ```

  If you are importing component JavaScript with ES6 imports, you will need to update your imports to include the JavaScript:

  ```javascript
  // Components
  import Header from '../node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/components/header/header';
  import SkipLink from '../node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/components/skip-link/skip-link';
  import Details from '../node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/components/details/details';
  import Radios from '../node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/components/radios/radios';
  import Checkboxes from '../node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/components/checkboxes/checkboxes';

  // Polyfills
  import '../node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/polyfills';

  // Initialize components
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    Details();
    Header();
    SkipLink();
    Radios();
    Checkboxes();
  });
  ```

  Note: You may need to change the path to `node_modules` depending on your project structure.

:wrench: **Fixes**

- Tidy dependencies - Removed unnecessary JavaScript linting NPM packages
- JS utils - Fix toggleClass util which duplicated classes if there was no other class before it, more tests added

## 3.0.0 - 7 November 2019

:boom: **Breaking changes**

- Non-text colour contrast for WCAG 2.1 ([Issue 473](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/473)). Our focus states now meet the new WCAG 2.1 level AA requirements.

  If you are using Sass and have created new components, you will need to migrate to the new accessible focus states.

  ### Mixins that have been removed

  The Sass mixins `nhsuk-focusable`, `nhsuk-focusable-fill` or `nhsuk-link-style-focus` have been removed. You can use the `nhsuk-focused-text` mixin instead.

  Include the `nhsuk-focused-text` mixin inside your component's `:focus` selector. For example:

  ```scss
  .app-component:focus {
    @include nhsuk-focused-text;
  }
  ```

  ### Colour variables that have been removed

  Some colour variables have also been removed. You can use the suggested replacement if you were using them in components that have been extended or created.

:boom: **Breaking changes**

- Deprecation of the [Feedback banner](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/issues/151) and [Emergency alert](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-service-manual-backlog/issues/149) components.

   If you are using Sass and JavaScript (ES6) imports, you will need to remove the imports for these components. You will also no longer be able to use the Nunjucks macros.

  **Sass**

  If you are importing component styles individually, you will need to remove the imports for the emergency alert and feedback banner:

  ```scss
  @import 'node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/components/emergency-alert/emergency-alert';
  ```
  ```scss
  @import 'node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/components/feedback-banner/feedback-banner';
  ```

  If you import all the component styles with `@import 'node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/core/all';`, you don't need to update your Sass imports.

  **JavaScript**

  If you are importing component JavaScript with ES6 imports, you will need to remove the imports and initialisation for the feedback banner:

  ```js
  import nhsuk_feedbackBanner from 'node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/components/feedback-banner/feedback-banner';
  ```
  ```js
  nhsuk_feedbackBanner(3000);
  ```

  <hr>

:boom: **Breaking changes**

- Refactor component JavaScript to make it more robust and use the latest ES6 coding standards ([Issue 425](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/425)) ([Issue 450](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/450))

  **JavaScript**

  If you are importing component JavaScript with ES6 imports, you will need to update the imports to:

  ```js
  // Components
  import Header from './components/header/header';
  import SkipLink from './components/skip-link/skip-link';
  import Details from './components/details/details';

  // Initialize components
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    Details();
    Header();
    SkipLink();
  });
  ```

  If you are already importing JavaScript with these export names, you can change the default export name.

:new: **New features**

- Organisational logos - the Header component now supports organisational logos. The organisational logo can be SVG code, with the organisation name and descriptor being editable through code, or a static PNG asset. You can also change the colour of the header and navigation menu from blue (default) to white ([Issue 446](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/446)).

  **SVG logo**

  [Preview the header organisational component](https://nhsuk.github.io/nhsuk-frontend/components/header/header-org.html)

  Organisation names can be edited as text in the `nhsuk-organisation-name` span element.
  Longer organisation names can be split onto multiple lines with `nhsuk-organisation-name-split` span. (The NHS England brand guidelines explain when this must be done.)
  The organisation descriptor can be used with the `nhsuk-organisation-descriptor` class name span.

  See [NHS England brand guidelines - Organisational logos](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/organisational-logos/) for more information on organisational logos.

  **PNG logo**

  You can also use a static asset, such as a PNG image.

  ```
  <a class="nhsuk-header__link" href="/" aria-label="Anytown Anyplace Anywhere NHS Foundation Trust homepage">
    <img class="nhsuk-org-logo" src="/path-to-assets/logo.png" alt="">
  </a>
  ```

The SASS `$nhsuk-font-light` variable has been remapped to use the `$nhsuk-font-normal` value as a defensive measure for now until it is decided to remove the `$nhsuk-font-light` variable completely. ([PR 460](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/460))

- Expander group component - Fixed expander group spacing issues when used with components with no top margin ([Issue 439](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/439))

- Update dependencies to their latest versions - this fixes a common security issue within the node-sass package. See https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/2625 for more details
- Search autocomplete - Fixed the query parameter on submit. [(Issue 459)](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/459) - Also added two new parameters to the nunjucks template to make it more versatile. [(Issue 458)
  ](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/458)

- Fixed `nhsuk-u-reading-width` utility class - the measurement has been adjusted to work with our base font size (16px) ([Issue 462](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/462))

## 2.1.0 - 8 April 2019

:new: **New features**

- Hero component - removed background image and arrow and tidied up area around the hero with image and content when in Windows high contrast mode. ([PR 435](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/435))

- Add transparent 1px border around promos which appears as a solid border when in Windows high contrast mode. ([PR 433](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/433))

- Fluid width container - Extend the page layout to include a fluid-width container, which spans the entire width of the viewport.
  Use `.nhsuk-width-container-fluid` for a full width container. Documentation and an example of the fluid-width container can be found on the Layout page in the NHS digital service manual.
  ([Issue 416](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/416))

- Prefix error messages with a visually hidden "Error:", to make it clearer to
  users of assistive technologies.

- Add example and code snippets for a Button as a link and remove the multiple examples for the disabled Button. The Button as a link includes the attribute `draggable="false"` to stop links that are styled as button from being dragged.

- Enable `autocomplete` attributes for input components. The `autocomplete` attribute can now be enabled on input, date input and textarea components using the component macros parameters.

  This was already possible to do with the `attributes` option but this change highlights the new WCAG 2.1 success criteria [Identify Input Purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html) which "is to ensure that the purpose of a form input collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined, so that user agents can extract and present this purpose to users using different modalities".

  See [Autofilling form controls: the autocomplete attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofill) for the full list of attributes that can be used.

- Enable `pattern` attribute for input component.

  You can now set the `pattern` attribute on input fields using the component macros:

  ```
  {{ input({
    "label": {
      "text": "Pattern example"
    },
    "id": "input-with-pattern",
    "name": "pattern-example",
    "pattern": "[0-9]*"
  }) }}
  ```

- Example of social media open graph cards for Twitter and Facebook

  Examples for [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/summary.html) and [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters/) have been added to the GitHub pages layout file and also to the [HTML page template](/docs/installation/installing-compiled.md#html-template).

  The open graph default image has also been added to the `assets/logos` folder of the package.

:wrench: **Fixes**

- Reorder the asset `preconnect` and remove unneeded `dns-prefetch` ([Issue 434](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/434))

- Header search icon padding has been altered due to the icon not being central for the desktop breakpoint.

## 2.0.0 - 11 March 2019

:boom: **Breaking changes**

- Hero component - Refactored hero component to not overlap with the header when zooming in / increasing the font size massively. There have been minor HTML changes so please update your code if you are using this component.([PR 411](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/411)), ([Issue 400](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/400))

:new: **New features**

- Summary list component - Use the summary list to summarise information, for example, a user’s responses at the end of a form.

  If you are importing all styles with `@import 'node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/nhsuk';` you will automatically have access to the new component when you update. Alternatively if you are importing each of the individual components separately you will need to import the component with `@import 'node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/components/summary-list/summary-list';`

  ([Issue 384](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/384))

:wrench: **Fixes**

- Button component - A fix for the :focus state to display a 4px yellow border. ([Issue 406](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/406))

- JavaScript variable scope - Globally scoped variables were causing issues with JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, so they have been moved to be locally scoped within functions. However, this could be improved as we have to duplicate variables between the multiple functions, so its likely this is a temporary fix before refactoring our JavaScript to be class based. ([PR 402](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/402)), ([Issue 398](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/398)).

  The JavaScript files will update automatically, when you update the nhsuk-frontend version and your application will work as normal.

## 1.0.1 - 20 February 2019

:new: **New features**

  that you require (if you are using a transpiler such as Babel). ([PR 258](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/258))

See more about using ES6 modules in your project in the [installing with npm - importing Javascript documentation](/docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md#option-2-import-javascript-using-modules).
