:wrench: **Fixes**

- Care card (immediate) - Fix colour contrast issue when using the Details component within the Care card (immediate) ([Issue 475](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/475))

- Open Graph image and meta data - use the latest Open Graph image and meta data from the NHS website. You can find this asset in the `packages/assets/logos` directory and the recommended meta data for Open Graph cards in the [Installing using compiled files - HTML template](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-compiled.md#html-template)

## 2.2.0 - 24th June 2019

:new: **New features**

- Footer - A variant for footer links to be in lists in 3 columns, which can be used when there are more than just a few links. You can find the markup and example in the [Footer component README](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/blob/master/packages/components/footer/README.md#footer-with-list-columns) [(Issue 168)](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/168)

- Favicon - The favicon design has changed and the favicon asset files have been updated in the `packages/assets/favicons` directory. The file names have stayed the same - but there are also some additional recommended favicon metadata tags for different devices. You can find a list of the recommended favicons to use in the [Installing with npm - importing assets documentation](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md#importing-assets-optional) and the [Installing using compiled files - HTML template](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-compiled.md#html-template). ([Issue 447](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/447))

:wrench: **Fixes**

- Remove light font version - The light version of the Frutiger font has been removed as it was only been used in one place. The SASS `$nhsuk-font-light` variable has been remapped to use the `$nhsuk-font-normal` value as a defensive measure for now until it is decided to remove the `$nhsuk-font-light` variable completely. ([PR 460](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/460))

- Expander group component - Fixed expander group spacing issues when used with components with no top margin ([Issue 439](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/439))

- Update dependencies to their latest versions - this fixes a common security issue within the node-sass package. See https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/2625 for more details

](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/458)

- Fixed `nhsuk-u-reading-width` utility class - the measurement has been adjusted to work with our base font size (16px) ([Issue 462](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/462))


## 2.1.0 - Apr 8, 2019

:new: **New features**

- Hero component - removed background image and arrow and tidied up area around the hero with image and content when in Windows high contrast mode. ([PR 435](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/435))

- Add transparent 1px border around promos which appears as a solid border when in Windows high contrast mode. ([PR 433](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/433))

- Fluid width container - Extend the page layout to include a fluid-width container, which spans the entire width of the viewport.
Use `.nhsuk-width-container-fluid` for a full width container. Documentation and an example of the fluid-width container can be found on the Layout page in the NHS digital service manual.
([Issue 416](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/416))

- Prefix error messages with a visually hidden "Error:", to make it clearer to
  users of assistive technologies.

- Add example and code snippets for a Button as a link and remove the multiple examples for the disabled Button. The Button as a link includes the attribute `draggable="false"` to stop links that are styled as button from being dragged.

- Enable `autocomplete` attributes for input components. The `autocomplete` attribute can now be enabled on input, date input and textarea components using the component macros parameters.

  This was already possible to do with the `attributes` option but this change highlights the new WCAG 2.1 success criteria [Identify Input Purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html) which "is to ensure that the purpose of a form input collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined, so that user agents can extract and present this purpose to users using different modalities".

  See [Autofilling form controls: the autocomplete attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofill) for the full list of attributes that can be used.

- Enable `pattern` attribute for input component.

  You can now set the `pattern` attribute on input fields using the component macros:

  ```
  {{ input({
    "label": {
      "text": "Pattern example"
    },
    "id": "input-with-pattern",
    "name": "pattern-example",
    "pattern": "[0-9]*"
  }) }}
  ```

- Example of social media open graph cards for Twitter and Facebook

  Examples for [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/summary.html) and [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters/) have been added to the GitHub pages layout file and also to the [HTML page template](/docs/installation/installing-compiled.md#html-template).

  The open graph default image has also been added to the `assets/logos` folder of the package.

:wrench: **Fixes**

- Reorder the asset `preconnect` and remove unneeded `dns-prefetch` ([Issue 434](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/434))

- Header search icon padding has been altered due to the icon not being central for the desktop breakpoint.

## 2.0.0 - Mar 11, 2019

:boom: **Breaking changes**

- Hero component - Refactored hero component to not overlap with the header when zooming in / increasing the font size massively. There have been minor HTML changes so please update your code if you are using this component.([PR 411](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/411)), ([Issue 400](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/400))

:new: **New features**

- Summary list component - Use the summary list to summarise information, for example, a userâ€™s responses at the end of a form.

  If you are importing all styles with `@import 'node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/nhsuk';` you will automatically have access to the new component when you update. Alternatively if you are importing each of the individual components separately you will need to import the component with `@import 'node_modules/nhsuk-frontend/packages/components/summary-list/summary-list';`

  ([Issue 384](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/384))

:wrench: **Fixes**

- Button component - A fix for the :focus state to display a 4px yellow border. ([Issue 406](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/406))

- JavaScript variable scope - Globally scoped variables were causing issues with JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, so they have been moved to be locally scoped within functions. However, this could be improved as we have to duplicate variables between the multiple functions, so its likely this is a temporary fix before refactoring our JavaScript to be class based. ([PR 402](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/pull/402)), ([Issue 398](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-frontend/issues/398)).

  The JavaScript files will update automatically, when you update the nhsuk-frontend version and your application will work as normal.

## 1.0.1 - Feb 20, 2019
