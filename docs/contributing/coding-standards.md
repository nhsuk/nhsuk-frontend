## HTML

Use valid HTML5 where possible.

Use HTML according to its purpose. Use elements for what they have been created for. This is important for accessibility, reuse and code efficiency reasons.

### Syntax

- Use soft tabs with two spaces - they're the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment.
- Nested elements should be indented once (two spaces).
- Always use double quotes, never single quotes, on attributes.
- Don't include a trailing slash in self-closing elements - the HTML5 spec says they're optional.
- Don’t omit optional closing tags (e.g. `</li>` or `</body>`).

### Attribute order

HTML attributes should come in this particular order for easier reading of code.

- `class`
- `id`, `name`
- `data-*`
- `src`, `for`, `type`, `href`, `value`
- `title`, `alt`
- `role`, `aria-*`

Classes make for great reusable components, so they come first. Ids are more specific and should be used sparingly (e.g., for in-page bookmarks), so they come second.

## SCSS

### Class naming convention

All class names start with a `.nhsuk-` namespace to reduce the likelihood of
conflicting with existing classes in your application. It also helps to identify
where the styling for a particular element is coming from.

If you are building components for your own application or framework you should
use a different prefix, for example `.app-` or the initials of your department.

### Block Element Modifier (BEM)

NHS.UK frontend uses the Block Element Modifier (BEM) methodology when naming
CSS classes. This is designed to help developers understand how the different
classes relate to each other.

The naming convention follows this pattern:

```scss
.block {}
.block__element {}
.block--modifier {}

.nhsuk-promo              // Block - the root of a component
.nhsuk-promo__heading     // Element - a part of the block
.nhsuk-promo--small       // Modifier - a variant of the block
```

It uses double hyphens (`--`) and underscores (`__`) so that the block, element
or modifiers themselves can be hyphen delimited without causing ambiguity.

For example:

```scss
.nhsuk-a-z-nav
.nhsuk-a-z-nav__link
.nhsuk-a-z-nav__link--disabled
```

### Nesting

Break elements and modifiers outside of blocks rather than nesting using a
parent selector `&`. 

Nesting pseudo elements like `:before` and `:hover` is ok.

This makes the codebase easier to read, and makes it easier to search for a
given class name. It also discourages excessive nesting.

Bad:

```scss
.nhsuk-contents-list {
  ...
  &__item {
    ...
    &:before {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

Good:

```scss
.nhsuk-contents-list {
  ...
}

.nhsuk-contents-list__item {
  ...
  &:before {
    ...
  }
}
```

BEM stands for `Block__Element--Modifier`, not `Block__Element__Element--Modifier`.

Avoid including multiple elements when naming classes.

### Single Responsibility Principle

Each class has a single purpose, so you can be sure when making a change to a
class - it will only affect the element that class is applied to.

Also when deprecating classes, all of the CSS for this class can be removed
without affecting another component that had reused this css.

**Why?**

To ensure that styles can safely be added or removed without fear of breaking
other components.

### Component modifiers

Keep all of the variants of a component in the same place.

`.nhsuk-error-summary` modifies the `.nhsuk-list` component.

Component modifiers use an extra class, scoped to the component:

`.nhsuk-error-summary__list`

This class is part of the component, rather than a parent of a component.

**Why?**
This makes it easier to keep track of different contexts.

### Code comments

All scss files should have comments (with intent rather than implementation). Line comments should all go within 
the top block comment and then a reference to the number should go next to the line of code.

Example: 

```scss
/* ==========================================================================
   #TITLE
   ========================================================================== */

/**
 * Long-form comment.
 *
 * This spans multiple lines and is also constrained to no longer than 80
 * characters in width.
 *
 * 1. Provide line-comments like this.
 */

.X-class {
  color: red; /* [1] */
}
```

## Javascript

We're still writing our JavaScript style guide, as we're only just figuring it out ourselves.

---

## Nunjucks

We have chosen as Nunjucks as the templating language for NHS.UK frontend components. We expose those templates as reusable chunks of code: macros. Developers import macros into their application, call them as per documentation and provide data to its arguments.

To provide a level of consistency for developers we have standardised argument names, their expected input, use and placement. There are expectations, and  if so they are documented accordingly.

### Specifying content

When providing *content* to a macro, say for a label or a button, we accept two argument options:

 - `text` accepts a plain string and is the default way of passing content
 - `html` accepts html markup. In the template we will not escape html so it will be rendered. In a scenario where both text and html are set, html argument will take precedence over text.

Example:

```
{{ insetText({
  "text": "You'll need to stay away from school, nursery or work until all the spots have crusted over. This is usually 5 days after the spots first appeared."
}) }}
```

```
{{ insetText({
  "HTML": "<p>If you drive you must tell the <a href='https://www.gov.uk/contact-the-dvla/' title='External website'>DVLA</a> about your vertigo. Visit the GOV.UK website for more information on <a href='https://www.gov.uk/dizziness-and-driving' title='External website'>driving with vertigo</a></p>"
}) }}
```

Example of implementing logic in a component template:

`{{ params.html | safe if params.html else params.text }}`

Example shows that if `html` and `text` arguments are present, then `html` takes precedence over `text` and we are not escaping it.

### Naming attributes

We should use **camelCase** for naming attributes.

### Specifying multiple items

When a component accepts a *single array of items* for an output, such as checkboxes or radios, we accept an ***"items"*** array of objects.  Table component is an exception is it can contain multiple array for rows, head, footer where there is need to for more specific names.

Example:

```
{{ listPanel({
  items: [
    {
      URL: "/aaa",
      link: "AAA"
    },
    {
      URL: "/abdominal",
      link: "Abdominal aortic aneurysm"
    },
    {
      URL: "/abscess",
      link: "Abscess"
    }
  ]
}) }}
```

### Use of classes to specify variants

When a component has multiple visual presentations, such as the care cards, we make use of classes argument to differentiate between them.

Care card non-urgent (blue) example:
```
{{ careCard({
  "type": "primary",
  "heading": "Speak to a GP if:",
  "HTML": "
  <ul>
    <li>you're not sure it's chickenpox</li>
    <li>the skin around the blisters is red, hot or painful (signs of infection)</li>
    <li>your child is <a href='https://www.nhs.uk/'>dehydrated</a></li>
    <li>you're concerned about your child or they get worse</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Tell the receptionist you think it's chickenpox before going in. They may recommend a special appointment time if other patients are at risk.</p>
  "
}) }}
```
Care card emergency (red and black) example:
```
{{ careCard({
  "type": "emergency",
  "heading": "Ask for an urgent GP appointment if:",
  "HTML": "
  <ul>
    <li>you're an adult and have chickenpox</li>
    <li>you're pregnant and haven't had chickenpox before and you've been near someone with it </li>
    <li>you have a weakened immune system and you've been near someone with chickenpox</li>
    <li>you think your newborn baby has chickenpox</li>
  </ul>
  "
}) }}
```

## Components

You can find NHS.UK frontend components in `packages/components`.

Components must use the `.nhsuk-` namespace.

For example, `.nhsuk-promo`.

### Writing SCSS for components

Components must follow the conventions described in our SCSS coding standards.

Components must:
* use classes for child elements, scoped to the parent component
* be flexible, not set a width or external padding and margins
* set internal margins in a single direction
* not rely on any other selector outside of the component scss file to style its children

#### Component folder structure and naming

Component folder and files should be singular, except in cases where they are more commonly used in groups, for example, radios and checkboxes.

An example component exists in `app/examples/components/component-example`.

Use this as the basis for creating new components.

The folder structure should be:

    component-name
      - `_component-name.scss`
      - `component-name.js`
      - `macro.njk`
      - `README.md`
      - `template.njk`
