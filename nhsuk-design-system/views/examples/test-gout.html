                    <li>the pain is getting much worse and you have a very high temperature (you feel hot and shivery) </li>

        <h2>What happens at your appointment</h2>

        <p>Gout can be hard to diagnose as symptoms are similar to other conditions.</p>

        <p>Your GP may ask about your diet and if you drink beer or spirits. </p>

        <p>You might be sent for a blood test, ultrasound or X-ray. Sometimes a thin needle is used to take a sample of fluid from the affected joint to test. </p>

        <p>The tests will find out how much of a chemical called uric acid there is in your body. </p>

        <p>Having too much can lead to crystals forming around your joints and causing pain.</p>

        <h2>Treatment to reduce pain and swelling</h2>

        <p>Attacks of gout are usually treated with anti-inflammatory medicine like ibuprofen.</p>

        <h2>Treatment to prevent gout coming back</h2>

        <p>Gout can come back every few months or years. It can come back more often over time if not treated. </p>

        <p>If you have frequent attacks or tests show you have a high level of uric acid in your blood, your GP might prescribe medicine called allopurinol or febuxostat. </p>

        <p>This is used to lower the levels of uric acid and needs to be taken in the long term.</p>

        <h2>Things that can trigger a gout attack</h2>

        <p>You might get an attack if you're very stressed or have had an illness. </p>

        <p>If you injure or bruise a joint and it's more painful than you would expect after a minor bump, it could be an attack coming on.</p>

        <p>Get treatment straightaway if you feel an attack coming on.</p>

        <h2>Who gets gout</h2>

        <p>Gout sometimes runs in families. </p>

        <p>It's more common in men, especially as they get older.</p>

        <p>Other people at risk include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>women after the menopause</li>
            <li>people who take medicines such as diuretics (water tablets) for blood pressure, or have high levels of cholesterol</li>
            <li>people who are overweight and who drink alcohol, especially beer</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="complications">

        <h2>Complications of gout</h2>

        <p>It's rare to get lots of attacks, but if you do, you can develop permanent damage to the joint (chronic gout).</p>

        <p>Chronic gout can also cause tiny white lumps (tophi) to appear under your skin, especially on your ears, fingers or elbows. This is where urate crystals form under the skin. They can be painful.</p>

        <p>You can get kidney stones if your uric acid levels are very high, so you'll need treatment to reduce the levels.</p>
