		<h3>Other symptoms</h3>
		<p>You might get symptoms before or after the spots, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>a high temperature above 38C</li>
			<li>aches and pains, and generally feeling unwell</li>
			<li>loss of appetite</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Chickenpox is very itchy and can make children feel miserable, even if they don't have many spots. Chickenpox is usually much worse in adults.</p>
		<p>It's possible to get chickenpox more than once, although it's unusual.</p>

<section id="how-its-spread">






<h2>It's easy to catch chickenpox</h2>

<p>You can catch chickenpox by being in the same room as someone with it. It's also spread by touching clothes or bedding that has fluid from the blisters on it. </p>

<h3>How long chickenpox is infectious for</h3>

<p>Chickenpox is infectious from 2 days before the spots appear to until they've crusted over, usually 5 days after they first appeared.</p>

<h3>How soon you get symptoms after coming into contact with chickenpox</h3>

<p>It takes 1 to 3 weeks from the time you were exposed to chickenpox for the spots to start appearing.</p>

<section id="infection-in-pregnancy">






<h2>Chickenpox in pregnancy</h2>

<p>It's rare to get chickenpox when you're pregnant and the chance of it causing complications is low.  </p>

<p>If you do get chickenpox when you're pregnant, there's a small risk of your baby being very ill when it's born. </p>

<p>Speak to your GP if you haven't had chickenpox and you've been near someone with it.</p>

<section id="vaccination">






<h2>The chickenpox vaccine</h2>

<p>You can get the chickenpox vaccine on the NHS if there's a risk of harming someone with a weakened immune system. </p>

<p>For example, a child could be vaccinated if one of their parents was having chemotherapy. </p>

<p>You can pay for the vaccine at some private clinics or travel clinics. It costs between £120 and £200.</p>

<section id="shingles-and-chickenpox">






<h2>Shingles and chickenpox</h2>

<p>You can't catch shingles from someone with chickenpox. You can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles if you haven't had chickenpox before.</p>

<p>When you get chickenpox, the virus stays in your body. It can be triggered again if your immune system is low and cause shingles. </p>

<p>This can be because of stress, certain conditions, or treatments like chemotherapy.</p>
